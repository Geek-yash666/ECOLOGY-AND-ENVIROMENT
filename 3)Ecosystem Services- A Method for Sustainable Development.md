## COURSE-3: Ecosystem Services: a Method for Sustainable Development (üîó[Course Link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ecosystem-services))

&nbsp;

### WEEK-1: quiz of module 1! (100% score)

 **1)** Yes.

 **2)** all [options].

 **3)** The Ecosystem Services Approach consists of bringing to light the contributions of Nature to human well-being but also the hidden costs of some human activities.

 **4)** It can help a government or decision makers find a balance between the needs of its citizens today and the needs of people in the future (&)

It can help evaluate the consequences of two or more plans being considered, in terms of who will benefit and who will potentially suffer drawbacks.

 **5)** False.

 **6)** d, b, a, e, c

 **7)** Ecological functions and ES functions are different, but have some overlap (&) ES functions are a subset of ecological functions.

 **8)** Change in radiative forcing, Species extinction rate and Amount of nitrogen removed from atmosphere.

 **9)** Gender inequality in literacy rates.

 **10)** Promoting reproductive rights, Insulating homes and Minimizing food waste.

 **11)** Reduction of flooding impact (&) Access to electricity for the local industry and population (&) Additional job, skills and infrastructure built locally.

 **12)** In my opinion (Martin Schlaepfer) one of the primary benefits is not the technical analyses, nor the novelty of the answer that is derived through a participatory process, but rather the pedagogical value of getting people around a table and discussing through a challenge using a common, agreed-upon framework. It is through such collaborative processes that minds are changed in a deep manner, once individuals are enlightened to many of the hidden benefits of nature to our well-being, they can carry' those values with them into numerous daily decisions.

### **WEEK-2: Take the quiz of module 2! (100% score)**

 **1)** 0%

 **2)** a careful weighing of different ethical and socio-economic factors.

 **3)** Existence value

 **4)** hedonic valuation method.

 **5)** If the J/HP (high restrictive) scenario were to be implemented, future generations would be the primary beneficiaries of this course of action. And extractive, dredging and fishing industries would face restrictions that could lead to short-term economic losses.

 **6)** G/MCS

 **7)** False

### **WEEK-3:quiz of module 3! (100% score)**

 **1)** that despite the total increase in publications, there are different publications citing each other within clear sub-sets, indicating coherent but separate cluster-communities.

 **2)** It means it can be changed. &  It means that the idea emerged within specific social, political and economic contexts, and did not exist as such before.

 **3)** No, this example shows how good ideas crucially need to be taken up by individuals with good networks.

 **4)** The real difference with the Ecosystem Service approach is not in putting price on services provided by nature (like pest control by birds), but rather the transformation of such processes into commodities, and the creation of markets to exchange these.

 **5)** Because it becomes unavoidable and might stop us imagining alternatives.

 **6)** all [options]

 **7)** He is concerned that applying and ecosystem services approach without taking into account questions of power might perpetuate or develop further economic and social inequalities between individuals.

 **8)** The ecosystem services approach might have a role to play in evaluating outcomes for different options for local development and land management.

 **9)** NO [Many critical social scientists would disagree with the position that market-driven solutions will lead to the fairest and most-efficient solutions, and there are multiple examples where markets instead perpetuate unfair distribution of power. Sequence 3.8 goes further into this.]

 **10)** When development is carried out somewhere to the detriment of biodiversity, this is compensated for somewhere else.

### **WEEK-4:quiz of module 4! (100% score)**

 **1)** Digital Elevation Model,  Precipitations and temperatures, Land Use.

 **2)** Agenda setting, policy design, policy implementation and review & Assessing the potential impacts of climate, demographic and land use changes.

 **3)** Decision-makers should know about uncertainties in assessing ecosystem services (&)   A human-environment system can be diagnosed as following: ‚ÄúUrban planners should foster the management of green urban areas providing cooling services to urban dwellers‚Äù.

 **4)** A key variable to monitor and understand the state of an ecosystem service and how it is changing.

 **5)** The most difficult task is to fill the gap between scientific knowledge and policy makers.

 **6)** A national ecosystem services mapping should be based on various indicators per ecosystem service.

 **7)** have esthetical value., can store carbon., are likely to provide a cost effective approach for delivery services in the long-run., can support biodiversity.

 **8)** One interesting approach is to compare how ecosystem services are predicted to evolve under various scenarios (following a standard ecosystem service methodology) but then add a variant in which a biodiversity-protection measure is included. This is what was done in the Bateman science paper (see Figure 3, compare maps D and F). The authors showed that adding an additional constraint of limiting development in some regions to favour biodiversity had an almost insignificant impact on the net present value of the optimal solution, suggesting one way to try an optimise ecosystem services AND promote biodiversity.

### **WEEK-5:Multiple Choice questions on Module 5 (100% score)**

 **1)** all [options]

 **2)** Basic maps and simple indicators that are easy to understand (&) Decisions makers were able to integrate across a mix of monetary and non-monetary valuation techniques. (&) The process, data acquisition, and decision making should be done with a representative group of stake-holders because this will increase the legitimacy of the groups findings.

 **3)** 2015

 **4)** It is a method that was designed by NGOs, governments and business as a way for private companies to measure the impact of their activities on the environment and society.

 **5)** Historically the finance sector has been primarily focused about generating financial returns. Increasingly, there is a realisation that long-term sustainability will require investors and entrepreneurs to think about their social, environmental AND economic impacts. The triple-bottom line is thus the approach of measuring a project or company's performance simultaneously in these three areas.

 **6)** [any option].
